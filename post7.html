    <p id="post7-body"> Computers have the ability to do whatever we program them to do. For example, process information on a quantum level, perform surgeries using Ai and robotics, create complex simulations and models that would be too difficult and strenuous for the human mind. This is accomplished by making packages of software that perform a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for other applications (Gillis, n.d.). This is why I am interested in computer applications. The only limit is our own imagination. If we can think of it then we can create it using libraries, databases, programming languages, APIs, and various other processes that assist us in reaching the full potential of development.
        Computer applications and information technology are deeply connected. Software plays an integral part in information technology. Since IT is such a broad field and normally is used as an umbrella term which can include but is not limited to cybersecurity, web development, data science, software, hardware, and databases. There would be no programming languages without computer applications, for example, Python and JavaScript would never have been created by software developers and software architects. Nor would there be any other web applications or mobile apps. Without the invention and implementation of computer applications, none of these would be possible.
Since the dawn of modern computers, they have worked hand in hand with computer applications to process large amounts of data. The application made processes easier instead of relying solely on the human brain for such tedious and arduous tasks. 
Computer applications rely on a major of hardware to function properly. These components work with applications to store memory, run faster, transport information between computers, and so much more. Applications need memory to run, the CPU tells the application which programs to run, applications interact with pieces of hardware like the keyboard or mouse pad to input data into the computer. Without any of these components, the applications would not function or know how to carry out instructions for the computer to properly work. 
	A programming language is a computer application. Computer applications execute the computer's commands through the input of certain hardware functions. Once the code is written by a developer it then gets processed as a set of instructions for the computer to follow. It can be transformed into machine language by a converter or certain kinds of compilers. The execution of these applications is important to the functioning of a computer. Programming languages write the code for it to be translated by a computer so it can then be executed. 
	Computer applications rely on databases to retrieve stored information. For example, a lot of back-end and full-stack development databases are referred to. My chosen topic relies on databases and database management because they are the backbone of many web applications and provide a way to organize and manage a lot of the stored information of an application. A good database can handle or process the large amount of information applications have.
Databases are relied upon heavily by computer applications for storing information, providing security, and serving as the backbone for computer applications.
